Richard Jenkins entered into a treaty with Mudhoji on 6 January 1818, which was later ratified by the Governor General. Article 7 of the treaty stated: \"The two hills of Seetabuldee with the bazaars and land adjoining, to a distance to be hereafter specified, shall be henceforth included in the British boundary, and such Military works erected as may be deemed necessary.\" By this treaty, the British occupied the Sitaburdi hills and large areas on all four sides.
